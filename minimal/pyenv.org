* What is a virtual environment and why do you want one?
** Virtual Environment is an is an isolated working copy of Python which
   allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting 
   other projects.([[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/][pydocs]])
*** For example, you can work on a project which requires Django 1.7 
    while also maintaining a project which requires Django 1.5.
* What is a non-system version of python?
** For Linux and Mac OS X versions of python come pre-installed.  These 
   can sometimes lag, especially the bleeding edge versions. Upgrading
   by compiling from source can break your system. (See the following,
   [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18834381/i-broke-python-what-can-i-do][I-broke-python]], [[http://askubuntu.com/questions/333109/upgrading-to-python-2-7-5-on-ubuntu-12-04][Upgrading-to-python-2.7.5]].) Certain libraries under
   active development may also require a specific version of python in
   order to use a critical feature, Django, IPython, pandas,
   matplotlib, scikit-learn and scipy. (See [[http://ipython.org/faq.html][IPython-requires-2.6.x]],
   [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3008509/python-version-2-6-required-which-was-not-found-in-the-registry][required-python-version-not-found]], [[http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#dependencies][pandas-no-longer-supports-2.5.x]]
   and [[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/install/][django-requires-2.7.x]])

* What is [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv][pyenv]]?

   python versions through the use of [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv#understanding-shims][shims]]. It does 
   not debend on any version of python and was forked
   from [[https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv][rebenv]].
* How do I use pyenv?
  - First install it ([[http://mofj.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2014/01/20/ubuntu-set-up-a-virtual-environment-with-ipython-numpy-and-pandas/][mine]], [[http://askubuntu.com/questions/333109/upgrading-to-python-2-7-5-on-ubuntu-12-04][KBowen]] or [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv#basic-github-checkout][Yyuu]])
  - Demo time...
* What is pyenv-virtualenv?
** [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv][pyenv-virtualenv]] is a [[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv][pyenv]] plugin that provides a
